"""Test suite for the booz_xform_jax package.

This directory contains a selection of tests ported from the original
booz_xform project.  The tests exercise the high‑level Python API,
regression comparisons against reference boozmn files, round‑trip
I/O and plotting functions.  They can be run with pytest or the
standard unittest runner.  The presence of this file allows pytest
to discover the tests when invoked from the project root.
